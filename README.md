# expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension

This extension allows you to easily add your applications icon to the iOS share sheet of other applications like Safari.
It wil handle (nearly) all the for you, like registering the iOS Share Extension and enables Deep Linking.

## Installation

Install it in your project:

```sh
expo install expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension
```

In your app’s Expo config (app.json, or app.config.js), make sure that `expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension` has been added to the list of plugins. Under scheme, define your apps scheme.

```app.json
"expo": {
  "name": "my-app",
  "scheme": "myapp",
  "plugins": [
      ["expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension"]
  ]
}
```

### Package version incompatibility
Currently there is a bug in the package `xcode` this library depends on. For now a workaround is needed, where the `xcode` package get's patched automatically.

- Run §npm install --save-dev package-patch§
- Copy this repo's patch folder to the root of the project
- Add `"postinstall": "patch-package"` to the scripts section in package.json.

## Usage
To determine which URL was passed to your application, you can read the app open url.

```
import { useURL } from "expo-linking";
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const url = useURL();

  return <Text>URL: {url}</Text>;
}
```

The format of the url is: `[schema]://share/?url=[shared url]`

## Building

Next, rebuild your app.

```
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

## Known limitations

- Currently, [only URL receiving](https://github.com/langtube/expo-config-plugin-ios-share-extension/blob/24a68b4e6efbcde4c3485bfec91dad476e0c9933/src/writeShareExtensionFiles.ts#L82) is supported
- Only support directly redirect to [Containing app](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionOverview.html).
  - [Here's an article](https://medium.com/kraaft-co/how-i-reached-the-limits-of-react-native-by-implementing-an-ios-share-extension-4f312b534f22) that explains why this approach was chosen.
